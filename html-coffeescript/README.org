This isn't a BDD base, but a simple interactive
visualization of a BDD generated from a truth
table, using [[https://coffeescript.org/][coffeescript]],
[[https://d3js.org/][d3.js]], and a layout constraint package
called [[https://ialab.it.monash.edu/webcola/][webcola]]

As of this writing, there seems to be a bug that
prevents it from rendering correctly in firefox
-- try chrome instead.

Also, I didn't really invest enough time to get cola
to render nicely, so the generated BDD diagrams are
pretty weird-looking.

You can run this code on jfiddle.net, if you prefer:
