This is a simple Binary Decision Diagram module written in pure python.

Feel free to use it under the terms of the MIT/X11 license.

However, it's probably most useful for comparison to the other versions in this repo.

The one thing that might be especially useful is the file [[pyBDD/gen_norms.py][gen_norms.py]],
which generates a normalized form for every if-then-else expression of 3 input variables.
I've used the output of this script for testing the =ite= function common to pretty much all my BDD implementations.

For an industrial strength python BDD package (which also includes bindings to various C/C++ implementations), consider:
