BDD Implementation (?) in [[https://freepascal.org/][free pascal]].

This one doesn't appear to be very fleshed out. It certainly doesn't implement a full BDD Base.

It requires [[https://github.com/tangentstorm/xpl/blob/master/code/xpc.inc][xpc.inc]]
and [[https://github.com/tangentstorm/xpl/blob/master/code/xpc.pas][xpc.pas]]. These
are standalone files from a large body of pascal libraries I've written over the years:
